[Based on the [IACR PKC 2020 code of conduct](https://pkc.iacr.org/2020/conduct.php)]

## Code of Conduct (online conference)
The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of QCrypt; these require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. For these reasons, the QCrypt 2020 organizers are committed to providing a harassment-free conference experience.

If you experience harassment or discriminatory behavior at a QCrypt event, we encourage you to reach out to someone who could help, listed below.

Special rules apply for online conferences. **We require that every participant in an online conference represent themselves by the name that they use for their professional work.** In addition, any speech or imagery that are posted in the chats of the various conference activities must be appropriate.

Participants who violate this code may be sanctioned and/or expelled from the event, at the discretion of the organizers. Serious incidents may be referred to the QCrypt steering committee for further possible action. Any action will only be taken with the consent of the complaining party.

If you witness harassment or discriminatory behavior, please consider intervening.
