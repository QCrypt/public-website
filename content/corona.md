## Potential impact of coronavirus outbreak on QCrypt 2020
The QCrypt Steering Committee and the local organizers of QCrypt 2020 are closely monitoring the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and assessing its potential impact on the upcoming conference. So far, the Netherlands is only mildly affected and thus QCrypt 2020 is planned to take place as scheduled. However, in case the conference has to be canceled and/or participants from certain regions will not be able to physically attend due to travel restrictions, measures will be taken to ease the burden and to nevertheless promote the accepted papers. These measures include having a more flexible cancellation and refund policy, and allowing alternative methods of presentation (such as pre-recorded videos).
