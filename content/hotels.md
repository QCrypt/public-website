## Accommodation for QCrypt
Therefore, accommodation will be expensive and
difficult to find. We strongly encourage all participants to book their accommodation as early as possible.

We have managed to secure offers from the following hotels:

  * THE STUDENT HOTEL:
  * NH Schiller
  * NH Doelen
  * Eden Hotel
