The annual QCrypt conference is the main international event that is dedicated to the latest developments in the field of quantum cryptography. Researchers from all over the world present their recent scientific discoveries in the field and companies display their latest relevant technology. The topic of the conference covers all aspects of cryptographic security in the presence of quantum devices, including - but not limited to - quantum key distribution, quantum randomness generation, and the impact of quantum computers on classical cryptography.

The 10th anniversary edition of the conference, QCrypt 2020, will take place in Amsterdam, August 10-14, 2020. The conference is expected to host between 300 and 400 researchers and scientists from the leading international academic research groups and engineers and industry representatives from international companies that are interested in quantum cryptography as a practical technology.

QCrypt 2020 is looking for sponsors. Sponsoring the conference gives companies and institutions the opportunity to call the attention of the participants of QCrypt 2020, and to present themselves during the conference by having their logo displayed, their leaflet distributed and, if desired, by being present at the conference with a booth. For QCrypt 2020, sponsorship is a crucial means to pay for certain features of the conference like tutorial talks and keynote speakers, as well as registration waving and travel grants for students from less privileged institutes. There are different sponsor packages available.
