Abstract: In this talk I will first cover some of our recent QKD progress towards increasing the reach and key rate using superconducting nanowires single-photon detectors designed specifically to optimise these goals. In a second part I will present the principle behind ID Quantiqueâ€™s QRNG chip, which is now deployed in mobiles phones. I will discuss how its entropy output is modelled and guaranteed to provide solid grounds for this mass-market security application.
