Abstract: In this tutorial talk, we will present the current landscape in quantum key distribution, focusing on the practical aspects of the most prominent technologies. We will highlight the main challenges for the miniaturization of such systems and for their integration into telecommunication networks, and discuss prospects for long-distance operation in both optical fibre and satellite-based links aiming at a global quantum communication infrastructure. We will also touch upon implementations of quantum cryptographic protocols beyond QKD, and discuss possible use cases for QKD and other protocols in various scenarios of interest in terms of performance and trust requirements, emphasizing the efforts required for the industrialization of the underlying technology.
