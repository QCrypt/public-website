## General format
The virtual edition of QCrypt 2020 will closely follow the example of the IACR conferences [Eurocrypt 20](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2020/) and [PKC 20](https://pkc.iacr.org/2020/) that were recently held online. The authors of accepted papers are asked to prepare and upload a 20-25 minute video of their talks that will be available on YouTube several days before the conference.

From Monday, 10 August to Friday, 14 August 2020,
- the main program of the conference takes place  as zoom webinar,
- participants can talk to each other on Slack,
- the poster sessions and networking breaks will take place on https://remo.co .

All partipants of QCrypt 2020 are bound to the [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct-online) which in particular states that they have to represent themselves by the full name that they use for their professional work. Violations of the code of conduct should be reported as [indicated here](/code-of-conduct-online).

### Tutorial talks, Invited talks
The tutorial and invited talks are given live on the zoom webinar, and simultaneously streamed to YouTube. Webinar participants can ask questions via the zoom Q&A functionality. The speaker will answer the most important questions after the talk on zoom. After each session, the speaker is moving over to https://remo.co and will be available there to answer more individual questions (as it is usually the case at real-life conferences).

### Contributed talks
After making a 20-25 minute video of their talks available before the conference, the live "online" part of presenting contributed articles is divided into thematic sessions. Each session will include a live 5-minute talk briefly presenting each paper, followed by a panel discussion involving the speakers of the session and moderated by members of the program committee.

### Poster sessions
The list of accepted posters with PDFs will be available on this website before the conference. The two poster sessions take place on https://remo.co :
- One poster/presenter per table
- Poster on table white board as picture file (jpg etc.), not as pdf (but also “offline” available on QCrypt website)
- Table name = Poster number plus first few words of poster title
- List of posters with number, name and author(s) on global white board.
- Tables/lounges for sponsors.
