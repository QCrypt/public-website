    "abstract": "Entanglement is an intriguing quantum phenomenon with crucial implications for both fundamental physics and technological applications, e.g., quantum key distribution (QKD). In this paper, we show that multipartite private states from which secret keys are directly accessible to trusted partners are genuinely multipartite entangled states. With application to secure Quantum Internet, we consider the most general setup of multipartite quantum process (channel) in a network setting: multiplex quantum channel with involved parties having one of the three possible roles-- that of only sender or receiver, or both sender and receiver. We derive divergence-based measures for entangling abilities of multipartite quantum channels. We describe an LOCC-assisted secret key agreement (SKA) protocol for generation or distillation of key (private random bits) among multiple trusted allies connected through a quantum multiplex channel secure against a quantum eavesdropper, of which measurement-device-independent QKD and SKA protocols over quantum network laced with key repeaters are particular instances. We are able to provide upper bounds on the non-asymptotic private capacities, maximum rate at which secret key can be distilled via \ffinite uses of channels, and lower bounds on asymptotic capacities. These bounds are expressed in terms of the divergence-based entanglement measures of the channels. Some of these measures lead to strong converse bounds on the private capacities. Our upper bounds on the private capacities also are upper bound on the multipartite quantum capacities where goal is to distill Greenberger{Horne{Zeilinger (GHZ) state. Also, we are able to derive upper bound on the secret key bits that can be distilled via LOCC among trusted allies sharing \ffinite copies of multipartite quantum states."

    "abstract": "At present, the performance of quantum digital signatures (QDSs) is limited by key generation protocols (e.g., BB84 or measurement-device-independent protocols), which are fundamentally limited in terms of channel capacity. Fortunately, the recently proposed twin-field quantum key distribution can overcome this limit. Here, we for the first time propose a twin-field QDS (TF-QDS) protocol and give a corresponding security analysis. It can not only possess the highest security among all existing QDS protocols, but also exhibit outstanding performance in terms of both signature rates and secure transmission distances. Therefore, our work represents another step towards practical implementation of QDSs."

The security of quantum key distribution in this case is proved only under the assumption that either the output of the sender side or the input to the receiver side are single-photon signals, which impose a restriction over the class of possible eavesdropping strategies. Here we present a security proof without such a restriction and, thus, solve this important problem and prove the security of quantum key distribution with detection-efficiency mismatch against general attacks. In particular, we propose an adaptation of the decoy state method to the case of detection-efficiency mismatch."

For a periodic function $f$ these algorithms produce -- via some quantum embedding of $f$ -- a quantum superposition $\\sum_x \\ket{x}\\ket{f(x)}$, which requires a certain amount of output qubits that represent $\\ket{f(x)}$. We show that one can lower this amount to a single output qubit by hashing $f$ down to a single bit in an oracle setting.\r\n\t\t\r\nNamely, we replace the embedding of $f$ in quantum period finding circuits by oracle access to several embeddings of hashed versions of $f$. We show that on expectation this modification only doubles the required amount of  quantum measurements, while significantly reducing the total number of qubits. For example, for Simon's period finding algorithm in some $n$-bit function $f: \\mathbb{F}_2^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_2^n$ our hashing technique reduces the required output qubits from $n$ down to $1$, and therefore the total amount of qubits from $2n$ to $n+1$. We also show that Simon's algorithm admits real world applications with only $n+1$ qubits by giving a concrete realization of a hashed version of the cryptographic Even-Mansour construction.\r\n\t\t\r\nOur oracle-based hashed version of the Ekerå-Håstad algorithm for factoring $n$-bit RSA reduces the required qubits from $(\\frac 3 2 + o(1))n$ down to $(\\frac 1 2 + o(1))n$. In principle our hashing approach also works for the Mosca-Ekert algorithm, but requires strong properties of the hash function family. A hashed version of Mosca-Ekert with as few as $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ qubits would imply classical polynomial time factoring.\r\n\r\nkeywords: Quantum period finding, Simon, Even-Mansour, Shor, Ekerå -Håstad, Mosca-Ekert, minimizing qubits"

A pressing and necessary issue for the design of quantum network protocols is the quantification of the rates at which these tasks can be performed. Here, we propose a simple recipe that yields efficiently computable lower and upper bounds on the maximum achievable rates. For this we make use of the max-flow min-cut theorem and its generalization to multi-commodity flows to obtain linear programs. We exemplify our recipe deriving the linear programs for bipartite settings, settings where multiple pairs of users obtain entanglement in parallel as well as multipartite settings, covering almost all known situations.

We consider a scenario where the server performs universal fault-tolerant quantum computation and the user gains access to the output using a pseudo-random circuit. We show that a private key much smaller than the size of the output may prevent unauthorised access. For an n-qubit computation, a standard approach requires an n-bit key to scramble the state. We provide an information-theoretic proof showing that obfuscation can be achieved with order n−Hmin(𝖷) secret bits, where Hmin(𝖷) is the min-entropy of the output of the computation. As interesting computations are expected to have large min-entropy, this represents a substantial reduction of the key size."

    "abstract": "Quantum physical systems have unique properties that can provide benefit to both cryptography and computation.  One such property is intrinsic randomness.  The outcome of certain quantum processes is inherently random, meaning that no amount of prior information will allow one to predict it.  An example is the measurement of a polarized photon: if a photon can be prepared in a perfectly diagonal state and then sent into a perfectly horizontal polarization filter , the event that it will pass through the filter is a perfectly unbiased coin flip.\r\n\r\nThe property of intrinsic randomness has potential applications, especially in the field of cryptography, where the quality of random cryptographic keys is important and one must guard against a wide range of cheating strategies by an adversary.  An experiment like the one described above, if carried out correctly, guarantees both the freshness and the randomness of the bits generated, even if the adversary has unlimited computational power.\r\nThis type of randomness is qualitatively different than randomness obtained from, say, a pseudorandom number generator, which is a deterministic algorithm that does not produce any new entropy.\r\n\r\nYet, if this qualitative difference is to be perceived as an advantage, it is necessary to address the problem of \\textit{certifiability}.  We would like the randomness to be verifiable by the user, regardless of any defects -- intentional or otherwise -- in the devices used.   Can randomness be certified to a skeptical party?  And if quantum technology is intended for broad use, we should ask a stronger question: Can quantum randomness be certified through strictly classical (non-quantum) means?  In other words, is it possible to set up an experiment in which none of the quantum processes (quantum state preparation, gates, measurements) are trusted, and yet be able to prove that the outcome of the experiment is truly random?\r\n\r\nThe above problem is called \\textit{device-independent random number generation}.  The primary success in this field so far has been achieved through the use of photonic Bell experiments.  The Bell experiment is a fundamental test of physics \\cite{bell_epr_1964} in which two entangled qubits are separated at a distance and then measured using a random measurement.  (For example, the qubits are polarization-entangled photons, and they are measured at a random angle.)  If the measurement statistics observed are outside the ``classical'' domain (that is, they are impossible to explain  by a  local hidden variable) by a statistically significant amount, then with high confidence we can conclude that a quantum  measurement has taken place, and therefore some randomness is present in the outcome.\r\n\r\nThis approach to random number generation --- properly called randomness expansion, since one needs some initial randomness to choose the measurement settings --- was originally proposed by Colbeck in 2006.  It was followed by several papers that provided security proofs of steadily increasing degrees of security and of efficiency In the last few years -- starting nearly a decade after Colbeck's original proposal -- device-independent random number generation has been realized in experiment marking the success of a major (and highly collaborative) transition from theory to experiment in quantum cryptography.\r\n\r\nRandomness expansion from Bell experiments achieved the original goal of device-independence: the randomness of the outcome depends only on (classically testable) assumptions about micro-timing of the experiment. However, these protocols have practical limitations. For example, if a client is receiving numbers over the Internet from a distant server, she is in no position to check for herself the small-scale timing assumptions of the Bell experiment.   Can such a client, engaging in classical communication with a distant server, ever be convinced that the random numbers output by the server are random?\r\n\r\nRecently, a surprising alternative approach to device-independent random number generation has been developed. If the client is willing to assume computational limitations on a distant server \\textit{only during the period of communication}, then it is possible to prove that the numbers she obtains from the  server are indeed random. \r\nThe first proof of this approach was given by Brakerski et al.  in 2018.\r\nThis is different from some previous results on device-independence, since it does require a computational restriction, and yet it still has advantages over  a classical pseudorandom number generator, since the computational assumptions need only be made while the protocol is underway (and these assumptions need to be made only on the server, not on any outside adversary).\r\nThe key to Brakerski’s approach  is that the server is required to solve computational problems that are believed to only be solvable by a quantum computer (``quantum supremacy'') and this guarantees intrinsic randomness in the outputs of the server.\r\n\r\nThe approach of Brakerski’s approach  involves \r\nan interactive dialogue in which\r\nthe server prepares and then measures a superposed state specified by the client.  \r\nThe security proof inBrakerski’s approach \r\nis based on the hardness of the LWE (learning with errors) problem.\r\nSeparately, Aaronson has proposed \r\na different approach to random number generation from quantum supremacy: in his approach, the server simply receives a description of a random quantum circuit from the client, executes the circuit several times, and returns the outputs back to the server. \r\nThis has the prospective advantage of being easier to implement on near-term quantum devices, since it does not require quantum memory nor error-correction.  A security proof for Aaronson's approach has not yet appeared.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this paper is to take a first step toward the experimental implementation of random number generation from a quantum computer.  Since our focus is on near-term implementation, we follow Aaronson's proposal (that is, generating random numbers from random quantum circuits).\r\n\r\nThe protocol that we use works as follows. The client generates challenge circuits which it sends to an untrusted server that operates a quantum computer.\r\nThe server responds to the challenges by sending a requested number of bitstrings. When the server is honest, it produces the bitstrings by sampling from the circuit using the quantum computer, so the bitstrings contain entropy due to the inherent randomness of\r\nquantum measurements. By performing a statistical test on the bitstrings received from the server, the client, using classical computing resources, is able to gain confidence that the server was behaving honestly, and thus to certify that the bits indeed contain some amount of entropy. The client can then pass the raw bitstrings through a randomness extractor to obtain random bits of higher quality, in the sense of being closer to the uniform distribution."

Until now, quantum one-way functions have several input-output categories such as `classical-to-classical', `classical-to-quantum' and `quantum-to-classical', which are used for post-quantum cryptography or quantum cryptography. However, there are still no intrinsic `quantum-to-quantum' quantum one-way functions. In this paper, we propose the full quantum one-way function to design full quantum cryptographic schemes. By concatenating the `quantum-classical' one-way function and the rotation operation of a single qubit, the full quantum one-way function has the input and output of quantum states. We prove its one-way property from `easy computation' and `computationally difficult to invert'. Then we apply the full quantum one-way function to quantum identity authentication. Security analysis shows that the proposed quantum identity authentication scheme based on the full quantum one-way function is secure even under active attacks."

Compared with other terms in quantum cryptography, quantum obfuscation attracts less attention and is still in its infancy due to its difficulty in implementation and application. In this paper, we define a quantum point function and construct its obfuscation, then demonstrate the validity of applying quantum point obfuscation to quantum symmetric encryption scheme. We rigorously prove that IND-secure quantum symmetric encryption can be realized by quantum point obfuscators. Furthermore, with the properties of combinability or auxiliary inputs, a quantum point obfuscator can implement IND-CPA (indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack)-secure quantum symmetric encryption or leakage-resilient quantum symmetric encryption, respectively. This work presents new usage of a quantum obfuscator and will complement the theory of quantum obfuscation."

Additionally, we reduce the communication complexity by a factor of O(n^3 log(n)) qubits per node, as compared to existing protocols. To achieve universal computation, we develop a distributed procedure for verifying magic states, which allows us to apply distributed gate teleportation and which may be of independent interest.

Similar to bills of paper money, most quantum money schemes assign a unique serial number to each money state, thus potentially compromising the privacy of the users of quantum money. However in a quantum coins scheme, just like the traditional currency coin scheme, all the money states are exact copies of each other, providing a better level of privacy for the users.\r\nA quantum money scheme can be private, i.e., only the bank can verify the money states, or public, meaning anyone can verify. In this work, we propose a way to lift any private quantum coin scheme -- which is known to exist based on the existence of one-way functions, due to Ji, Liu, and Song (CRYPTO'18) -- to a scheme that closely resembles a public quantum coin scheme. Verification of a new coin is done by comparing it to the coins the user already possesses, by using a projector on to the symmetric subspace. No public coin scheme was known prior to this work. It is also the first construction that is very close to a public quantum money scheme and is provably secure based on standard assumptions. The lifting technique when instantiated with the private quantum coins scheme, due to Mosca and Stebila 2010, gives rise to the first construction that is very close to an inefficient unconditionally secure public quantum money scheme."

Quantum cryptography, especially key distribution, has become one of the most prominent applications of quantum technology.

A natural question, therefore, is can users' technological requirements be reduced?  In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a novel quantum key distribution protocol where users are fully classical and quantum operations are only performed by an untrusted third party acting as a server.  We derive an information theoretic proof of security for our protocol along with an experimental demonstration."

    "abstract": "Private information retrieval (PIR) is a database query protocol that provides user privacy, in that the user can learn a particular entry of the database of his interest but his query would be hidden from the data centre. Symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) takes PIR further by additionally offering database privacy, where the user cannot learn any additional entries of the database. Unconditionally secure SPIR solutions with multiple databases are known classically, but are unrealistic because they require long shared secret keys between the parties for secure communication and shared randomness in the protocol. Here, we propose using quantum key distribution (QKD) instead for a practical implementation, which can realise both the secure communication and shared randomness requirements. We prove that QKD maintains the security of the SPIR protocol and that it is also secure against any external eavesdropper. We also show how such a classical-quantum system could be implemented practically, using the example of a two-database SPIR protocol with keys generated by measurement device-independent QKD. Through key rate calculations, we show that such an implementation is feasible at the metropolitan level with current QKD technology."

    "abstract": "Solid-state quantum light sources emitting triggered single photons or entangled photon pairs have the potential to boost the performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Proof-of-principle experiments affirmed these prospects, but further efforts are necessary to push this field beyond its current status. In this work, we report on tools for the performance optimization of QKD systems using single-photon sources (SPSs). For this purpose, we developed a basic QKD testbed comprising a triggered solid-state single-photon source and a receiver module designed for four-state polarization coding via the BB84 protocol. Exploiting temporal filtering of the signal acceptance time window in a two-dimensional parameter space we analyze the sifted key fraction and the quantum bit error ratio (QBER) expected in in full implementations of QKD. Furthermore, we demonstrate real-time security monitoring by analyzing the QBER and the photon statistics, in terms of g(2)(\\tau), inside the quantum channel in real-time during the key distribution process. This is achieved by correlating the photon flux recorded at the four ports of our receiver. Our findings can be directly applied and extended for advanced schemes of quantum communication representing an important contribution towards the development of QKD-secured communication networks based on quantum light sources."

    "abstract": "In the age of measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI QKD) and twin-\ffield QKD (TF QKD), the source units of these QKD schemes may become a new ``Achilles' heel\" of the whole system. An adversary, Eve, can conduct various attacks on the sources by injecting lasers, whose power is limited by the laser-induced damage threshold of the quantum channel. Such an amount of power may modify the characteristics of components in a source. In this work, we study possible components to protect the source from the light-injected attacks, i.e., Trojan-horse attack, the laser-seeding attack, and the laser-damage attack. Experimental testing shows that fiber-optics isolators and circulators are good passive countermeasures because they sacrifice themselves' isolation under a high-power laser to protect other components behind them. Moreover, we find that illuminated by the high-power laser, integrated photonics QKD chips only lose the transmission of the coupler before any other change happens for the other components in the chips."

Practical quantum random number generators (QRNG) usually need to trust their devices, but their security can be jeopardized in case of imperfections or malicious external actions. In this work, we present a robust implementation of a Semi-Device-Independent QRNG that guarantees both security and fast generation rates.\r\nThe system works in a prepare and measure scenario where measurement and source are untrusted, but a bound on the energy of the prepared states is assumed. Our implementation exploits heterodyne detection, which offers increased generation rate and improved long-term stability compared to alternative measurement strategies. In particular, due to the tomographic properties of heterodyne measurement, we can compensate for fast phase fluctuations via post-processing, avoiding complex active phase stabilization systems. As a result, our scheme combines high security and speed with a simple setup featuring only commercial-off-the-shelf components, making it an attractive solution in many practical scenarios."

We provide a tight numerical key rate analysis of discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocols in the asymptotic limit against collective attacks. As a specific example, we analyze the key rate of the quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) scheme in both the paranoid and realistic scenarios. When the detector noises are trusted, the QPSK scheme is expected to reach around 100 km with currently feasible experimental parameters. For both scenarios, we also investigate the performance of post-selection of data for the reverse reconciliation scheme and show that post-selection can provide improvements in the key rate as well as reducing the amount of data for post-processing."

The test consists only in local quantum operations and authenticated classical communication once a state is shared among them and provides composable security, namely it can be used as a secure subroutine by n honest parties within larger communication protocols to test if a source is sharing quantum states that are at least ϵ-close to the GHZ state. This claim comes on top of previous results on multipartite entanglement verification where the security was studied in the usual game-based model. Here we improve the protocol to make it more suitable for practical use in a quantum network and we study its security in the Abstract Cryptography framework to highlight composability issues and avoid hidden assumptions. This framework is a top-to-bottom theory that makes explicit any piece of information that each component (party or resource) gets at every time-step of the protocol. Moreover any security proof, which amounts to showing indistinguishability between an ideal resource having the desired security properties (up to local simulation) and the concrete resource representing the protocol, is composable for free in this setting. Our protocol can typically be used as a subroutine in a Quantum Internet, to securely share a GHZ state among the network before performing a communication or computation protocol."

    "abstract": "Randomness is one of the key ingredients to information processing in practice, especially for computation and cryptography. A vast number of applications critically rely on abundant, high-quality random numbers that are generated securely. In this work we introduce a variant of randomness extraction framework, named \\emph{incoherent randomness extraction} (IRE), in the context of quantum coherence theory where free incoherent operations are employed. This cryptographic framework unveils a new perspective to the study of quantum coherence distillation (QCD) by an \\emph{exact} one-shot connection, that is, the maximum number of secure random bits extractable from a single instance of \\emph{unstructured} quantum state is precisely equal to the maximum number of coherent bits that can be distilled from the same state. This exact relation not only sharpens our understanding on the operational equivalence between randomness and coherence, but also enables us to derive tight second order expansions (estimation of the number of extractable random bits/distillable coherent bits to the order~$o(\\sqrt{n})$ where $n$ is the number of the prepared source states) of both tasks in the independent and identically distributed setting. Remarkably, the incoherent operation classes that can empower coherence distillation for generic states all lead to the same second order expansions, indicating their operational equivalence for QCD as well as IRE in both asymptotic and large block length regimes. As a by-product, we showcase a proof of the strong converse property for IRE from its second order expansion, excluding a possible tradeoff between the insecurity threshold and the rate of extractable randomness of a protocol. This also contributes to an alternative strong converse proof for QCD due to their exact one-shot correspondence."

In practice, this would require true photon number sources and photon-number-resolving detectors, but these technologies are still work-in-progress. In this work, we propose an efficient technique called double-decoy method which can provide relevant partial information of the input-output photon-number distribution, including the fraction of events in which the unknown quantum channel accepts and outputs a single photon. These detections correspond to events in which the transmitted single photon survives a basis-independent filter just before the measurement. We apply the double-decoy method to quantum key distribution (QKD) and show that it can substantially reduce the background noise and systematic error at the privacy amplification level, thereby improving the current secret key rate and achievable distance for standard QKD protocols. \r\nWe also believe that several applications beyond cryptography will benefit from this technique."

In this work we examine analogues of Bell's inequalities for such correlations, and derive a synchronous device-independent quantum key distribution protocol. This protocol has the advantage of symmetry between the two users and self-testing while generating shared secret key without requiring a preshared secret. We show that, unlike general correlations and the CHSH inequality, there can be no quantum Bell violation among synchronous correlations with two measurement settings. However we exhibit explicit analogues of Bell's inequalities for synchronous correlations with three measurement settings and two outputs, provide an analogue of Tsirl'son's bound in this setting, and prove existence and rigidity of quantum correlations that saturate this bound. We conclude by posing a security assumption that bypasses the locality, or causality, loophole and examine the protocol's robustness against measurement error and depolarization noise."

    "abstract": "We have come a long way since the first implementation of a quantum key distribution (QKD) system and various attacks have been demonstrated, such as the Trojan Horse Attack (THA). In this attack, the eavesdropper Eve gains information by analysing the back-reflections of light she shines into the QKD system. Almost all attacks have been demonstrated on devices based on fibre components. However, the first chip-scale QKD devices are being developed now, utilising the small size of integrated optics, the stability of the optical system and the ease at which it can be mass-produced, showing great commercial potential. Here we discuss a THA on chip-scale QKD. First, points of reflection in a QKD transmitter chip were found via a reflectometry. Based on this we give an experimental set-up to implement a THA which would give Eve access to 50% of the key. Full experimental results of this attack are expected in the next two to three months."

The classical notions and techniques do not transpose directly to the quantum setting. In this paper, we continue the line of work initiated by Boneh and Zhandry at CRYPTO 2013 and EUROCRYPT 2013 in which they formally define the notion of unforgeability against quantum adversaries specifically for Message Authentication Codes and Digital Signatures schemes. We develop a general and parameterized quantum game-based security framework for both classical and quantum primitives modelled by unitary transformations. We provide general possibility and impossibility results for such primitives. In particular, we show that no unitary primitive can provide existential unforgeability against quantum adversaries. Our main impossibility result relies on a new and generic quantum attack. We demonstrate this attack both on classical and quantum primitives to show its applicability as well as the completeness/integrity of our definitions of security. On the other hand, we show that selective unforgeability is satisfied by a specific class of unitaries that we term unknown unitaries."

    "abstract": "Recently, major progress has been made towards the realisation of the quantum internet to enable a broad range of applications that would be out of reach for classical internet. Most of these applications such as delegated quantum computation require running a secure identification protocol between a low-resource and a high-resource party to provide secure communication. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have been shown as resource-efficient hardware solutions for providing secure identification schemes in both classical and quantum settings. In this work, we propose two identification protocols based on quantum PUFs (qPUFs) as defined recently by Arapinis et al.\r\nIn the first protocol, the low-resource party wishes to prove its identity to the high-resource party and in the second protocol, it is vice versa. Unlike existing identification protocols based on Quantum Read-out of PUFs which rely on the security against a specific family of attacks, our protocols provide provable exponential security against any Quantum Polynomial-Time adversary with only polynomial resource parties. We provide a comprehensive comparison between the two proposed protocols in terms of resources such as quantum memory and computing ability required in both parties as well as the communication overhead between them. A stand-out feature of our second protocol is secure identification of a high-resource party by running a purely classical verification algorithm. This is achieved by delegating quantum operations to the high-resource party and utilising the resulting classical outcomes for identification.\r\n\r\nAn interesting application idea that emerges from our second protocol is certification or benchmarking of general quantum computation schemes based on purely running a classical test on the resulting measurement outcomes."

In some security demanding contexts, the perfect confidentiality that can be obtained with QKD combined with One-Time-Pad, may be insufficient. This will be in particular the case if the mere existence of communication can divulge crucial information. Performing QKD covertly solves this by insuring low probability of detection for the QKD signal states. \r\n\r\nWe study here for the first time Covert continuous variable (CV) QKD. We establish, in the general case of a thermal noise channel, that the covertness conditions impose drastic limits to the performance of such protocols. We then propose an original solution to overcome this limitation by performing a computationally-secure coherent block encoding, analogous to spread spectrum, to the signal pulses of a Gaussian modulated coherent state CV-QKD protocol.\r\n\r\n The resulting protocol provides covertness, under computational assumptions  while preserving the information-theoretical security on the final QKD key. We show that our method enables QKD over realistic WDM environments such as a 30 km optical backbone populated by 25 standard channels."

    "abstract": "Losses in the physical transmission medium fundamentally limit the distance that quantum key distribution schemes can cover. By means of quantum repeaters, the reach of these schemes can be extended and chains of quantum repeaters could in principle cover arbitrarily long distances. Here, we first provide an efficient algorithm for completely characterizing the behaviour of a large class of repeater chain protocols. The algorithm determines the fidelity and generation time (waiting time) of the first generated entangled pair between the end nodes of a quantum repeater chain. It has polynomial runtime in the size of the support of the waiting time probability distribution. This runtime improves upon the exponential runtime of existing algorithms and allows us to analyze repeater chains of thousands of segments for some parameter regimes. Second, we use the algorithm for optimizing the achievable secret key rate. For this, we consider a family of repeater schemes generalizing the BDCZ scheme. In particular, the schemes incorporate a cut-off condition that enables to mitigate the effects of decoherence. We find that the use of the optimal cut-off extends the parameter regime for which secret key can be generated and moreover significantly increases the secret-key rate for a large range of parameters. Our algorithms thus serve as useful tools for the design and realization of long-distance quantum key distribution networks."

    "abstract": "We consider a device-independent scenario where N parties test the Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) inequality. By exploiting the inequality’s symmetries, we drastically simplify the general form of the quantum state that can be considered, without loss of generality. We then derive an upper bound on the maximal violation of the MABK inequality attained by an arbitrary N-qubit state, as a function of the state’s parameters. The two results enable us to derive analytical bounds on the von Neumann entropy of the parties’ outcomes, conditioned on the eavesdropper’s information. These quantities are crucial for the security of many cryptographic protocols and better bounds lead to more robust protocols. In particular, we bound the conditional entropy of a single party’s outcome and the joint conditional entropy of two parties’ outcomes, as a function of the MABK violation observed by three parties. We extend the former bound to N parties and prove its tightness, while we observe that the latter significantly improves previous results."

We propose a novel estimation scheme which is based on the clusterization of the estimated transmittance data. We show that uncertainty about whether the transmittance is fixed or not results in a lower key rate. However, if the total number of measurements is large, one can obtain using our method a key rate similar to the non-fluctuating channel even for highly fluctuating channels. We also verify our theoretical assumptions using experimental data from an atmospheric quantum channel. Our method is therefore promising for secure quantum communication over strongly fluctuating turbulent atmospheric channels."

    "abstract": "With the emergence of quantum communication, it is of folkloric belief that allowing an Adversary to perform superposition queries to otherwise classical cryptographic protocols and forcing the honest players to perform actions coherently on quantum states automatically breaks the schemes' security. Another intuition is that enforcing measurements on the exchanged messages is enough to protect protocols from these attacks.\r\n\r\n\tHowever, the reality is much more complex. The security models dealing with superposition attacks only consider unconditional security. The first seminal papers date back to 1997 and prove the impossibility of unconditionally-secure bit-commitment schemes. Follow-up works heavily rely on this assumption of unconditional security to prove strong impossibility \r\nresults and their proof techniques cannot be applied to the computational setting. They essentially indicate that ideal primitives should in fact measure the input state. On the opposite, security models considering computational security assume that all supposedly classical messages are measured, which forbids by construction the analysis of superposition attacks.\r\n\tTo fill in the gap between those models, Boneh and Zhandry have started to study the quantum computational security for classical primitives in their seminal work at Crypto'13, but only in the single-party setting. To the best of our knowledge, an equivalent model in the multiparty setting is still missing.\r\n\r\n\tIn this work, we propose the first computational security model considering superposition attacks for multiparty protocols. We show that our new security model is satisfiable by proving the security of the well-known One-Time-Pad protocol and show an attack on a variant of the equally reputable Yao Protocol for Secure Two-Party Computations. The post-mortem of this attack reveals the precise points of failure, yielding highly counter-intuitive results: The attack vector consists of a (classically) seemingly inoffensive message and a measurement performed by the honest player. This example shows that adding extra classical communication, which is harmless for classical security, can make the protocol become subject to superposition attacks.\r\n\r\nOur results show that intuitions can be misleading when reasoning about cryptographic protocols in a quantum world, and that there is no evident answer to provide for either the vulnerabilities of classical protocols to superposition attacks or the adapted countermeasures."

Investigating the latter option, we introduce the Quantum Computational Hybrid (QCH) security model, where we assume that computationally secure encryption may only be broken after a time much longer than the coherence time of available quantum memories. We propose an explicit d-dimensional key distribution protocol, that we call MUB-Quantum Computational Timelock (MUB-QCT) where one bit is encoded on a qudit state chosen among d + 1 mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). Short-term-secure encryption is used to share the basis information with legitimate users while keeping it unknown from Eve until after her quantum memory decoheres. This allows to reduce Eve’s optimal attack to an immediate measurement followed by post-measurement decoding.\r\nWe demonstrate that MUB-QCT enables everlasting secure key distribution with input states containing up to O(\\sqrt{d})photons. This leads to a series of important improvements when compared to QKD: on the functional side, the ability to operate securely between one sender and many receivers, whose implementation can moreover be untrusted ; significant performance increase, characterized by a O(\\sqrt{d}) multiplication of key rates and an extension by 25km x log(d) of the attainable distance over fiber. Implementable with a large number of modes with current or near-term multimode photonics technologies, the MUB-QCT construction has the potential to provide a radical shift to the performance and practicality of quantum key distribution."

An HRE quantum memory unit integrates local unitary operations on its hardware level for the optimization of the readout procedure and utilizes the advanced techniques of quantum machine learning.

The protocols and their security are based on the existence of Bell inequalities and the ability to violate them by measuring entangled states. We study the entanglement needed for DIQKD protocols in two different ways. Our first contribution is the derivation of upper bounds on the key rates of arbitrary CHSH-based DIQKD protocols in terms of the violation of the inequality; this sets an upper limit on the possible DI key extraction rate from states with a given violation. Our upper bound improves on the previously known bound of Kaur et al. Our second contribution is the initiation of the study of the role of bound entangled states in DIQKD. We present a revised Peres conjecture that states that such states cannot be used as a resource for DIQKD. We give a first piece of evidence for the conjecture by showing that the bound entangled state found by Vertesi and Brunner, even though it can certify DI randomness, cannot be used to produce a key using protocols analogous to the well-studied CHSH-based DIQKD protocol."

The security proof builds on the quantum lower bound for the Direct-Product problem (\\cite{aaronson2012quantum,ben2016quantum}) and the quantumly unlearnability of the copy-protected functions. We can show that any adversary, in order to break anti-piracy, must have implicitly done one of the following two things: prepare another state that has almost the same functionality, breaking the lower bound for the Direct-Product problem; or learn the input-output behavior of the copy-protected function.\r\n\r\nWe also show that the existence of quantum copy protection and the quantum hardness of Learning-with-Errors (LWE) will imply publicly verifiable quantum money.

We prove that the protocol’s essential properties stand in the post-quantum setting assuming a general quantum adversary with suitably bounded number of queries in the Quantum Random Oracle (QRO) model. In order to achieve this, we investigate\r\nand bound the quantum complexity of a Chain-of-Proofs-of-Work search problem which is at the core of the blockchain protocol. Our results imply that security can be shown by bounding the quantum queries so that each quantum query is worth O(p^{−1/2}) classical ones and that the\r\nwait time for safe settlement is expanded by a multiplicative factor of O(p^{−1/6}), where p is the probability of success of a single classical query to the protocol’s underlying hash function."

    "abstract": "We initiate a systematic study to provide upper bounds on device-independent key, secure against a non-signaling adversary (NSDI), distilled by a wide class of operations, currently used in both quantum and non-signaling device-independent protocols. These operations consist of a direct measurements on the devices followed by Local Operations and Public Communication (MDLOPC). We formulate a security condition for the considered class of protocols, that is based on the newly introduced non-signaling norm. This norm takes supremum over certain operations, that can be used to discriminate devices. It is shown that the security condition based on this norm, is equivalent to two security conditions present in the literature. We employ the idea of ``squashing\" on the secrecy monotones, which provide upper bounds on the key rate in secret key agreement (SKA) scenario, and show that squashed secrecy monotones are the upper bounds on NSDI key. As an important instance, an upper bound on NSDI key rate called ``squashed non-locality\", has been constructed. It exhibits several important properties, including convexity, monotonicity, and additivity on tensor products. Using this bound, we identify numerically a domain of two binary inputs and two binary outputs non-local devices for which the squashed non-locality is zero. Therefore one can not distill key from them via MDLOPC operations. These are mixtures of Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) and anti-PR box with the weight of PR less than 80%. This example confirms the intuition that non-locality need not imply secrecy in the non-signaling scenario. The approach is general, describing how to construct other tighter yet possibly less computable upper bounds. Our technique for obtaining upper bounds is based on the non-signaling analog of quantum purification: the complete extension. This extension provides the ultimate eavesdropping power with the minimal consumption of eavesdropper's memory and, as we prove, yields equivalent security conditions as previously known in the literature."

    "abstract": "Classical remote state preparation (RSPCC) is a primitive that allows an honest client to prepare a quantum state remotely with the help of an (untrustworthy) server using only a classical communication channel. With this primitive quantum protocols (such as secure delegation of quantum computations) become accessible to classical clients, by removing the need for a quantum channel. Since this cryptographic primitive’s main role is to be a building block within larger protocols, it is of utmost importance to examine its security under composition. In this work we present three results related to the composability of RSPCC protocols:\r\n1. As our first main result, we show that no classical remote state preparation protocol RSPCC can be composable in the Abstract Cryptography framework [MR11], even when the distinguisher is computationally bounded. In other words, remote state preparation cannot be constructed with only a classical channel.\r\n2. We further show that any classical-client delegated quantum computing protocol that uses the universal blind quantum computation (UBQC) protocol [BFK09] and a RSPCC protocol as a subroutine cannot be composable.\r\n3. Upon relaxing the security requirement, we show that replacing the quantum channel of the UBQC protocol by the particular RSPCC protocol of [CCKW19] is secure in the game-based security framework."

Our analysis builds on the secure communication protocols developed for classical layered network architectures such as the open-systems interconnection (OSI) model and the transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) model.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel architecture of quantum-error-correction-based quantum repeaters that combines the techniques used in discrete and continuous variable quantum information. Specifically, we propose to encode the transmitted qubits in a concatenated code consisting of two levels. On the first level we use a continuous variable GKP code which encodes the qubit in a single bosonic mode. On the second level we use a small discrete variable code, encoding a logical qubit in as few as seven physical qubits. Such an architecture introduces two major novelties which allow us to make efficient use of resources. Firstly, our architecture makes use of two types of quantum repeaters: the simpler GKP repeaters that need to only be able to store and correct errors on a single GKP qubit and more powerful but more costly multi-qubit repeaters that additionally can correct errors on the higher level. We find that the combination of using the two types of repeaters enables us to achieve performance needed in practical scenarios with a significantly reduced cost with respect to an architecture based solely on multiqubit repeaters. Secondly the use of continuous variable GKP code on the lower level has the advantage of providing us with the information about the success probability of the specific GKP correction round. This analog information, unique to bosonic codes, provides significant boost in performance when used to correct second level errors in the multi-qubit repeaters."

    "abstract": "Knowledge extraction, typically studied in the classical setting, is at the heart of several cryptographic protocols. The prospect of quantum computers forces us to revisit the concept of knowledge extraction in the presence of quantum adversaries.    \r\n\r\nWe introduce the notion of secure quantum extraction protocols. A secure quantum extraction protocol for an NP relation R is a classical interactive protocol between a sender and a receiver, where the sender gets as input the instance z and witness $\\witness$ while the receiver only gets the instance z as input. There are two properties associated with a secure quantum extraction protocol: (a) {\\em Extractability}:  for any efficient quantum polynomial-time (QPT) adversarial sender, there exists a QPT extractor that can extract a witness w' such that (z,w') in R and, (b) {\\em Zero-Knowledge}: a malicious receiver, interacting with the sender, should not be able to learn any information about w. \r\n\r\nWe study and construct two flavors of secure quantum extraction protocols.\r\n\r\n- {\\bf Security against QPT malicious receivers}: First we consider the setting when the malicious receiver is a QPT adversary. In this setting, we construct a secure quantum extraction protocol for NP assuming the existence of quantum fully homomorphic encryption satisfying some mild properties (already satisfied by existing constructions [Mahadev,  FOCS'18, Brakerski CRYPTO'18]) and quantum hardness of learning with errors. The novelty of our construction is a new non black box technique in the quantum setting. All previous extraction techniques in the quantum setting were solely based on quantum rewinding. \r\n\r\n- {\\bf Security against classical PPT malicious receivers}: We also consider the setting when the malicious receiver is a classical probabilistic polynomial time (PPT) adversary. In this setting, we construct a secure quantum extraction protocol for NP solely based on the quantum hardness of learning with errors. Furthermore, our construction satisfies {\\em quantum-lasting security}: a malicious receiver cannot later, long after the protocol has been executed, use a quantum computer to extract a valid witness from the transcript of the protocol. \r\n\r\nBoth the above extraction protocols are constant round protocols. \r\n\\par We present an application of secure quantum extraction protocols to zero-knowledge (ZK). Assuming quantum hardness of learning with errors, we present the first construction of ZK argument systems for NP in constant rounds based on the quantum hardness of learning with errors with: (a) zero-knowledge against QPT malicious verifiers and,  (b) soundness against classical PPT adversaries. Moreover, our construction satisfies the stronger (quantum) auxiliary-input zero knowledge property and thus can be composed with other protocols secure against quantum adversaries."

It is an extension of the BBM’92 protocol which relies on measurements in the matching basis for entanglement witness. We then design an entanglement generation scheme over a quantum network that equips the quantum key generation protocol to achieve key rates that are independent of the distance between the two users. The key new insight in our protocol is to allow a repeater node to use n-qubit GHZ projective measurements that can fuse n successful entangled links, i.e., two-qubit entangled Bell pairs shared across network edges, incident at that node, into an n-qubit GHZ state shared by the far nodes of those edges. If we allow even 3-fusions at the nodes, we find by developing a connection to a modified version of the site-bond percolation problem that despite lossy (hence probabilistic) link-level entanglement generation, and probabilistic success of the fusion measurements at nodes, one can generate entanglement between end two parties at a rate that stays constant as the distance between them increases. This is not possible to attain with any (non-error-corrected) quantum networking protocol using Bell measurements alone."

    "abstract": "Entanglement distribution between very distant parties allows several interesting quantum-enabled protocols to be performed, in the fields of quantum communication, metrology and distributed computation.  However, achieving this task over global distances (thousands of km) is very daunting, due to the exponential losses of light in optical fibres.\r\nThe concept of a quantum repeater has been introduced to counter this problem. Such a device allows, using quantum memories and protocols based on entanglement swapping or quantum error correction, to connect several elementary links and enlarge the achievable distance.\r\nAn alternative solution is represented by satellite-relayed free-space channels, that have already been proven to be feasible with current technology. Using a double downlink from a single satellite, however, the maximum distance between the ground stations is limited to {1500-2000} km, due to the additional losses encountered at low elevation angles. Through quantum repeaters, few of these satellite links can be chained together to reach global distances. In this work we propose and study a scheme in which entanglement sources and quantum repeaters are placed on board of satellites, orbiting around the Earth in the string of pearls configuration. This allows to connect two users on the ground via free-space optical links outside the atmosphere, achieving far superior distance-to-loss ratio with respect to the standard fibre-based implementation. In this way, a small number of intermediate nodes is enough to achieve entanglement distribution over global distances at a reasonable rate.  \r\n\r\nThe performance of this repeater chain is assessed in terms of the secret key rate achievable by the BB-84 cryptographic protocol, taking into account the most important sources of noise. We perform a comparison with other repeater chain architectures and show that our scheme is superior in almost every situation, achieving higher key rates, reliability and flexibility. These results have been obtained assuming reasonably conservative values of the parameters of the setup, such as the size of the optical elements and the efficiency of the quantum memories.\r\nThe feasibility of the implementation in the mid-term future is analysed, based on recent developments in space-borne technology. We finally discuss some exemplary orbital configurations to connect several pairs of cities around the world with very small satellite constellations and estimate the cost of such an infrastructure. \r\nThe integration of satellite-based links with ground repeater networks can be envisaged to represent the backbone of the future Quantum Internet.\r\n\r\nC.

Our simulation results demonstrate that the 1-decoy state QKD protocol can be secure over\r\nlong distances within a reasonable time frame given that the intensity modulator is sufficiently isolated. By comparing the simulation results to those presented in Wang et al. (2018), we find that, as expected, the 1-decoy state QKD protocol is more robust against information leakage from the intensity modulator for all achievable distances."

Thus, it is the most promising method to establish a global scale QKD network. While the first QKD platform in the space - “the Micius satellite” – was a ground-breaking proof of principle demonstration, it is not a commercially favourable solution. We present our Cube-Sat payload design which has a more economically viable key-rate. The whole system is consisting of two parts, a 2U transmitter payload in Cube Satellite and an Optical Ground Station (OGS) working as receiver. The system is designed for polarisation based BB84/Decoy-State protocol with 100Mhz key transmission rate. In order to avoid the light pollution near the metropolitan centres and provide flexibility, we present our progress towards a mobile OGS which will be able to act as a receiver for the quantum signal."

However, due to atmospheric turbulence, achieving a highly efficient and stable spatial single-mode transceiver, which is very important for daylight free-space quantum key distribution and more complex quantum information tasks involving quantum interference, is difficult. Here, we develop a spatial single-mode transceiver with an adaptive optics (AO) system based on a modal version of the stochastic parallel gradient descent algorithm (M-SPGD) and conduct a field test of its performance over an 8 km urban terrestrial free-space channel. Our experimental results demonstrate the AO technology based on M-SPGD has a great boosting for single-mode transceiver and is useful for large-scale quantum communication."

Security proofs to recover the behaviour of regular BB84 have been presented in previous literature, though all of them used signal tagging to disregard the private information carried by the multi-photon components of the signals. This is overly conservative, as for unbalanced signals, the photon-number splitting attack does not leak full information to Eve. In this work, we exploit the flag-state squashing model to preserve some parts of the multi-photon generated private information in our analysis. Using a numerical proof technique, we obtain significantly higher key rates compared with previously published results in the low-loss regime. We also report a gain in key rates when part of the total loss is known to be induced by a trusted device. We highlight that the key rate improvement can be achieved without any experimental modification."

    "abstract": "Classical bits can be copied, but quantum bits, in general, cannot. As a result, there is interest in creating uncounterfeitable quantum money, in which a set of qubits can be spent as money but cannot be duplicated. To function as money, there must be a way to verify that a given state is a valid banknote and not a counterfeit. Many recent efforts have tried to allow public key verification, where any untrusted user, even a would-be counterfeiter, can verify the banknotes. However, despite many attempts, a secure construction of public-key quantum money has remained elusive.\r\n\r\nHere we introduce franchised quantum money, a new notion that is weaker than public key quantum money but brings us closer to realizing it.  Franchised quantum money allows any untrusted user to verify banknotes using a unique secret key. Furthermore, we give a construction of franchised quantum money and prove security assuming the quantum hardness of the short-integer solution problem (SIS). This is the first construction of quantum money that allows an untrusted user to verify the banknotes, and which has a proof of security based on widespread assumptions. It is therefore an important step toward public key quantum money.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder franchised quantum money, untrusted users receive unique secret verification keys. With their key, a user can verify banknotes without the mint involved, but they cannot create counterfeit money that would fool another user. This is different from public key quantum money because the verification key may actually enable counterfeiting, but the only person that the counterfeiter can fool is themselves.\r\n\r\nHere is how franchised quantum money might be useful: consider a group of large corporations, mutually distrustful, that nevertheless want to make transactions with each other. Further, a trusted third party, the mint, will administer the money system. While the mint cannot make verification public-key, it can franchise the ability to verify banknotes to the group of untrusted corporations. The mint gives each corporation a unique secret verification key that allows them to verify banknotes from another corporation.\r\n\r\nNow what if one corporation decides to start using its key to copy money? Since each corporation gets a different key, any banknotes that the corporation produces will fail to verify when a different key is used. Therefore the dishonest corporation will not be able to fool anyone but themselves.\r\n\r\nPublic key quantum money has eluded sophisticated attempts to construct it directly, so franchised quantum money is useful as a stepping stone. Although franchised quantum money is not public-key, it still enables verification without the mint involved, which is the main feature of interest for public key quantum money. Further, we give a construction of franchised quantum money with a proof of security based on widely-held assumptions about the SIS problem. Franchised quantum money offers greater security than existing constructions of quantum money, and brings us closer to public-key verification."

    "abstract": "Free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) is a promising solution for secure communication between two remote parties through free space. Due to the possibility of free space communication, in general, the application candidates of free space QKD are focused on secure communication between moving terminals. Such applications have characteristics such as moving position, outside operation, and limited internal space and power consumption. First, the moving position of a terminal needs active compensation of a shared reference between transmitter and receiver because general QKD protocols requires a shared reference frame, i.e., polarization reference in a QKD protocol using polarization encoding. This can be solved by using reference frame independent (RFI) QKD. Second, the outside operation brings intensive noise issue caused by the sun light which significantly degrades the performance of free-space QKD. The change of operating wavelength of QKD to 1550-nm and single mode fiber coupling can significantly alleviate the noise issue. Finally, the limitation of internal space requires to chip scale implementation. The use of 1550-nm wavelength provides comparability of integrated (silicon) photonic chips which is already studied in the fiber based QKD.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we provide a 1550-nm free-space RFI QKD system which incorporates the aforementioned solutions while the previous free-space RFI QKD is realized with visible wavelength. We also shows that our system achieves about 0.8% quantum bit error rate (QBER) without additional blocking out external light to the receiver through single mode fiber coupling. This low QBER indicates the possibility of daylight free-space QKD."

    "abstract": "Quantum communication in general helps deter potential eavesdropping in the course of transmission of bits to enable secure communication between two or more parties. In this paper, we propose a novel quasi-quantum secure direct communication scheme using non-maximally entangled states. The proposed scheme is simple to implement using existing techniques and significantly reduces the number of leaked bits. As a result long sequences or the whole sequence of data can be communicated at once before error checking for a potential eavesdropper. Also a cipher can be used in the protocol for retrieving the bits that are lost due to security. The qubit efficiency of the proposed protocol is found to be 40 %."

Further, Zhandry proposed a construction of quantum lightning based on superpositions of low-rank matrices. \r\n\r\nThe scheme is unusual, so it is difficult to analyze whether the scheme is secure and difficult to base the scheme’s security on any widespread computational assumptions. Instead, Zhandry proposed a new hardness assumption that, if true, could be used to prove security. While the new hardness assumption is plausible, it has not been rigorously analyzed.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we analyze the hardness assumption to determine how, if at all, it can be justified. We show that Zhandry’s hardness assumption is in fact false, so the proof of security for Zhandry’s scheme does not hold. While the scheme itself has not been proven insecure, our analysis suggests an approach to developing attacks that might prove the scheme insecure."

    "abstract": "In this poster, we explore an extension of the proof technique from [1] for measurement-device-independent(MDI) quantum key distribution (QKD) in the case Alice and Bob send noisy, i.e. mixed, signal states. We emphasize that having a consistent framework for optimally determining the security of QKD protocols employing mixed signal states from a trusted source is valuable since in any practical implementation of a protocol, even if the protocol calls for pure signal states, a realistic source will not be able to initialize a state with perfect purity; thus, we desire a security proof that can take into account the mixed nature of the signal states in an optimal manner, given that Eve may not hold the purification of the mixture.\r\n\r\nIn [1], the authors provide a method for characterizing the security of QKD protocols employing qubit signal states. Briefly, by employing only four states that form a tetrahedron on the Bloch sphere, their tilted four-state protocol demonstrates that Alice and Bob can exactly characterize the channel that Eve applies to their quantum states, and hence apply the secret key rate formula from the six-state protocol [2]. However, it is known that the security of a protocol employing trusted noisy signal states can additionally depend on the system which is not held by Eve that purifies the mixed states [3].\r\n\r\nIn the case state preparation noise can be trusted and characterized, but perhaps not reduced, we provide here a simple analytical and numerical toolbox for calculating the optimal value of the key rate. First, we provide a reframing of the tilted four-state loss-tolerant protocol to fix Eve’s Gramian matrix, which contains all the parameters in the secret key rate that depend on Eve’s system [1]. We show that the mixedness of the signal states can be treated in a virtual picture as being equivalent to Alice and Bob employing shield systems that can be used to decrease Eve’s knowledge of the key. Completely within this virtual picture, we can apply unitary twisting operations [4] to the shields to decrease the phase errors of the protocol, increasing the secret key rate. Finally, we find the optimal twisting operations for maximizing the six-state key rate by employing semidefinite programming techniques, a relatively recent numerical tool useful for security proof techniques [5, 6]."

    "abstract": "Device-independent quantum key distribution provides security even when the equipment used to communicate over the quantum channel is largely uncharacterized. An experimental demonstration of device-independent quantum key distribution is however challenging. A central obstacle in photonic implementations is that the global detection efficiency, i.e., the probability that the signals sent over the quantum channel are successfully received, must be above a certain threshold. We here propose a method to significantly relax this threshold, while maintaining provable device-independent security. This is achieved with a protocol that adds artificial noise, which cannot be known or controlled by an adversary, to the initial measurement data (the raw key). Focusing on a realistic photonic setup using a source based on spontaneous parametric down conversion, we give explicit bounds on the minimal required global detection efficiency."

    "abstract": "Free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) has received an increasing attention for its inherent secure communication between two remote systems. Most of the free-space QKD systems require integration of various signals such as quantum and beam tracking channels with different wavelengths into the same optical path for beam tracking. The beam tracking system, consisting of fast steering mirrors and position detectors, maintains optical beam path by adjusting the misalignments induced by moving terminals, vibrations and atmospheric turbulence in the free-space QKD system. Most QKD systems use dichroic mirrors for combining and separating quantum and beam tracking channels through free-space alignment. However, integration of such channels in free-space could require a large volume space, much alignment effort for mode overlap and can be easily affected by mechanical shock.\r\nIn this paper, we report the effect of using a fiber-based wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) filter for integrating the quantum and beam tracking channels in free-space QKD systems. A custom-made WDM filter was used in the transmitter part of the free-space BB84 QKD system, combining a 785 nm signal for quantum channel and a 1550 nm signal for beam tracking channel. HI780 fiber was selected for common output port of the device to maintain the orthogonality of polarization states and beam quality of the quantum channel. Although 1550 nm signal can suffer from the insertion and bending loss caused by smaller core size of the HI780 fiber, we could reduce the loss as low as 1.4 dB by designing the fiber with length within about 15 cm, well straightened. We could also obtain good beam quality and mode overlap of the quantum and beam tracking channels by using the common output port of the WDM filter."

    "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) over a free-space channel is challenging due to inefficient coupling of received signals to the detection system. A narrow detector cross-section, such as with fibre coupling to a telescope, reduces the field of view (FOV) and thus increases the loss due to atmospheric turbulence. A larger detector cross-section increases the FOV; however, the corresponding increase in background noise also increases the QBER associated with a Discrete Variable (DV) QKD system. On the contrary, Continuous Variable (CV) QKD systems are highly tolerant to background noise, but their performance is still limited by the channel loss.   The FOV of the receiver is defined as the area expressed in solid angle from which the detector can accepts signal. A simple geometrical analysis reveals FOV as $\\Theta = 2\\tan^{-1}(d/2F)$, where $d$ is the detector diameter and $F$ is the effective focal length of the receiver telescope.  With a large-area detector, one can design the signal collection optics, such that the FOV of the telescope with a given aperture can be larger. In this work, we present a larger FOV receiver system for CVQKD which reduces the channel loss due to beam wandering and atmospheric turbulence. We will describe the performance of the receiver system in terms of shot-noise sensitivity, loss reduction and enhancement in secure key rate, compared to a typical fibre-coupled receiver system."

In order to obtain the appropriate evolution models for states in the channel we use the SU(1,1) algebra formalism in the Liouville representation. Developed model is applied in cases of two different initial states as an example. The first is single- and multi-frequency-mode (e.g. wavelength-division-multiplexed) weak coherent states in quantum notation as rather simple but useful example. This particular example is of interest since weak coherent states are commonly used tool in various fields of optics, e.g. optical communication, quantum key distribution, etc. Results for coherent states are well agreed with classical theories however in order to highlight quantum features of developed theory we also consider the case of non-classical light, in particular Fock states. Considered implementation of model takes into account dichroism, retardance, thermalization, dispersion, decoherence in polarization domain. We derive expressions of evolved states, mean photon number and estimate the Stokes parameters as well as degree of polarization. Considered examples explicitly demonstrates all the features and effects of developed approach. Described approach allows to connect the information properties of quantum channels with its physical ones. In order to illustrate this statement we consider BB84 quantum key distribution protocol and investigate behavior of quantum bit error rate affected by considered physical phenomena in optical fiber."

Main difference to a prior studies in the field is that we do not use hyperentanglement or representation of the Bell states as concatenated Greenber–Horne–Zeilinger (C-GHZ) state to provide the discrimination. We demonstrate two different approaches for complete Bell state measurement based on different types of filtration. In entangled non-demolition measurement we allocate two pairs of the states from each other as the filtration process. The approach can be based on the utilization of cubic (Kerr) nonlinearity and auxiliary mode.  In semi-demolition measurement two states are unambiguously discriminated and hence destroyed; however two other states passes the filter without modification. The measurement destroys the single photon subspace in every mode and preserves the superposition of zero and two photons.  It can be realized with discrete photodetection based on microresonator with atoms. Such filtration can be considered as quadratic nonlinearity just as any measurement. The most significant about this approach is that we do not transform the initial states using any type of filtration based on different nonlinearities."

Since its introduction, several practical TF-QKD variants have been proposed, and some of them have already been implemented experimentally. All of them assume that the users can emit weak coherent pulses with a continuous random phase, either to generate the key, or to prove its security. In practice, this assumption is often not satisfied, which could open up security loopholes in their implementations. Here, we propose and prove the security of a TF-QKD variant that relies exclusively on discrete phase randomisation, which is easier to achieve in practice. Remarkably, our results show that it can also provide higher secret-key rates than other variants."

We already reported on the support for different DV and CV-QKD protocols, and high-performance error correction using GPUs for terrestrial QKD.\r\nHere we will discuss the following new capabilities of the software\r\n* a low dependency footprint for future use on satellites, \r\n* hibernation of QKD post-processing pipelines and switching between them for key establishment with different ground terminals and satellites,\r\n* CoAP interfaces to cover demands of the control and management plane in today’s network environment, and\r\n* the port to ARM/FPGA SoC boards.\r\nThe CoAP interfaces allow rapid scripting of QKD modules or AIT QKD based applications with Python or even Bash. Utilities and tools, as well as a boilerplate setup for QKD module coding projects, also support the creation of new QKD post-processing modules or QKD based user applications.  The AIT QKD software is bundled with management tools, partly GUI oriented.\r\nThe software is available under different license options and AIT welcomes suggestions from academic groups or industry to co-operate."

    "abstract": "Emerging quantum technologies, such as quantum key distribution, increase the demand for reliable tools that enable single-photon generation, manipulation and sensing on an increasingly large scale. In the framework of integrated photonics, these needs can be fulfilled by patterning highly stable photonic devices on monolithic silicon chips in CMOS compatible processes. In this work we show how advanced single-photon detection capabilities are achieved on a silicon chip, realizing a 4x4 array of waveguide-integrated superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). \r\nOur detectors are fabricated from highly uniform superconducting NbTiN thin films in a U-shape geometry atop of silicon nitride strip waveguides [1]. The nanophotonic circuitry is interfaced with scalable 3D polymeric out-of-plane fiber-to-chip couplers [2] featuring high broadband transmission in the telecom regime. In order to address each detector individually via a separate fiber-optic channel, we precisely align a 16-channel 2D fiber array to the 4x4 coupler matrix. We evaluate the performance of our waveguide-integrated SNSPD array in a cost-efficient closed-cycle cryostat at 3.5 K. We find dark count rates below 10 Hz combined with a superior system detection efficiency of up to 50 % at 30 MHz count rate for telecom-wavelength photons. In addition, we achieve 120 ps timing jitter with a simple two-stage room-temperature amplification approach.\r\nOur detector arrays pave the way for parallelized multi-channel single-photon detection and will therewith enable ultra-fast quantum key distribution. Furthermore, our approach allows for integrating sophisticated nanophotonic devices with waveguide-coupled single-photon detectors providing additional variability and functionality."

We solve the optimization numerically and utilize uniform continuity bounds to derive tight key rate lower bounds. We find that the key rates are comparable to previous conditional security proofs with the cut-off assumption, and to those achieved by Gaussian-modulated CVQKD."

After the proposal of the original protocol, multiple papers have extended the protocol to prove its security. However, these works are limited to the case where the two channels have equal amount of loss (i.e. are symmetric). In a practical network setting, it is very likely that the channels are asymmetric due to e.g. geographical locations. In this work we extend a version of the TF-QKD protocol to the scenario with asymmetric channels. We show that by simply adjusting the two signal states of the two users (and not necessarily the decoy states) they can effectively compensate for channel asymmetry and consistently obtain higher key rate than either using no compensation or using the strategy of deliberately adding fibre to the shorter channel. We perform simulation with realistic parameters and finite data size, and show that our method works well and has a clear advantage over prior art methods in the presence of channel asymmetry."

    "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) is designed to establish symmetric keys among two legitimate parties. Continuous variable (CV) QKD that uses the coherent states and homodyne detection can only apply the cost-effective telecommunication components[1]. The field test of CV-QKD has reached over 50 km[2], and under the laboratory conditions, experimental demonstration of over 200km has been reported [3], thus, has revealed great potentials in practical implementations. The access network that allows multitude end-users to connect to the nodal network is a necessary in the modern network infrastructure since it is suitable for general home-to-home scenarios. Quantum access network was first proposed [4] and demonstrated in field tests [5] for discrete variable QKD. Here, we report an upstream access network based on CV-QKD. In our experimental demonstrations, two transmitters Alice are deployed as optical network units that simultaneously send signals to the network, the receiver Bob is acted as the optical line terminal. The optical distribution network is located between the optical network units and the optical line terminal to couple the signals. The signals generated from each optical network unit are required to pass through a variable delay line to calibrate the arriving time at the optical distribution network before being transmitted. The signals are then simultaneously sent to the optical distribution network through fibers of 5.3 km and 12.3 km respectively. When the signals approach to the optical distribution network, dynamic polarization control modules are firstly applied in each path to pre-compensate the polarization. The signals are then coupled through a beamsplitter and forwarded to the optical line terminal. With a system repetition frequency of 2.5 MHz, we obtain the averaged secret key rates of 55 kbps and 22 kbps for Alice No. 1 and Alice No. 2 respectively. The total secret key rates has reached 77 kbps which suggests a higher network capacity. The excess noise is relatively stable, yet there are small fluctuations in the secret key rates. To one step further reduce the loss, the wavelength division multiplexing devices can be used at the optical distribution network. This is especially beneficial when the quantum signal has to co-propagate with classical data channels in the same fiber [6,7]. The upstream access network implementations can be easily extended to a higher repetition frequency system or to support more users. The demonstration experiments provide the possibility of building practical large-scale CV-QKD networks.

    "abstract": "We report the polarization-multiplexed CV-QKD with four-state modulation capable of full use of two orthogonal polarization channels and experimentally investigate it. We design a polarization and phase compensation scheme by introducing a pair of rather than one single regularly spaced reference data timemultiplexed with weaker signal data. The polarization mixing and relative phase can be estimated simultaneously by using the transmitted reference data and the corresponding detection data to calculate a overall rotation matrix, and compensated by rotating Bob's received data. The results show that combined with our efficient polarization and phase compensation scheme this low-complexity scheme can further improve the secret key rate\r\nand prompt CV-QKD to be network-compatible  and on-chip integrated."

    "abstract": "Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) uses shot-noise limited detection for measuring the quadratures of the signal sent by Alice over the quanutm channel. Typically, the signal transmission rate is limited by the bandwidth of the detection. One of the drawbacks of\r\nCV-QKD systems is low secure key generation rate at longer transmission distances. High bandwidth detectors—which allow higher signal transmission rates—cannot improve the key generation rate as these increase the electronic noise variance. Electronic noise variance in CV-QKD systems is considered as a trusted noise source and so theoretically, it does not have a great impact on the final key rate. However, from the practical point of view, there is impact on the performance of error correction codes—such as low density parity codes (LDPC). Increased electronic noise decreases the signalto-noise ratio (SNR). Constructing LDPC at lower SNR is a bottleneck for achieving long distance CV-QKD. Multi-mode signals can improve the SNR of CV-QKD system to a significant extent. In this work, we consider a multi-mode signal based CV-QKD system where signal modes are jointly measured in order to reduce the impact of electronic noise on the SNR."
